# Quick Start

### 1. Set up the Frontend

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the frontend application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 2. Set up the Backend

1. The backend uses MongoDB, so you'll need to have a MongoDB database configured either locally or using MongoDB Atlas.

2. Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder and add your MongoDB database URL to the variable `MONGODB_URI`:
    ```
    MONGODB_URI=your_database_url
    ```

3. Navigate to the `backend` directory in a different terminal window:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

4. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

5. Start the backend application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    The backend will start running.

### 3. Access the Application

At this point, both the frontend and backend should be running. You can use the application in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### 4. (Optional) Seed the Database

To load some dummy data into your database, you can send a `GET` request to:

```
http://localhost:3019/api/seed
```
